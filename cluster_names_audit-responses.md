*Most of these aren't good.*

Cluster 0: Maraschino-Threaded Spread (35 cocktails)
Doesn't make sense. There are only a few Maraschino drinks in here.

Cluster 1: The Stirred Vermouth Portfolio (33 cocktails)
Doesn't make sense. There are many non-Vermouth drinks in here.

Rum Tiki Corner has too many non-tiki drinks (and agave drinks). And doesn't include classics like Dark and Stormy or Mai Tai. This is the "angostura" group.

Equal-Parts Aperol Core - most DON'T HAVE APEROL! What is it about this cluster? I see that almost all of them have citrus, but then we have all kinds of other things. Old pal is a bit out of place.

Juniper Canon Panorama = wtf?? Too cute, and lots of non-gin drinks.
